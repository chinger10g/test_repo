Close the door
Turn the light off
Switch your mind off
Make it right for me
Pull the blind door
Try to wind down
Take the liberty

And then you'll see
Our love's here to last
Make it right for me
And then you'll see
Our love's here to last

We're gonna feel alive
Come and gimme your love
Gimme your love (x3)

We're gonna feel alive
